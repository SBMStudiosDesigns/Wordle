## Wordle Game | Python App
Wordle is a popular game where you guess a five-letter word in six tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

### Languages Used
I built this app using Python and Rich, a library for rich-text formatting.

### Reference
I followed freeCodeCamp's Python tutorial to create this app. Here's the [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-wordle-clone-using-python-and-rich/)
